### **Project Overview: Multi-Image Panorama Stitching with Keypoint Matching Visualization**

This project demonstrates how to create a panorama image by stitching multiple images together using **OpenCV** and **computer vision** techniques like keypoint detection, feature matching, homography estimation, and perspective warping. In addition, the project visualizes the keypoint matches between successive images, giving insight into how the images are aligned during stitching.

#### **1. Problem Statement**
When stitching multiple images into a panorama, we need to:
- Detect overlapping regions between consecutive images.
- Align the images based on feature matches.
- Warp the images so that their overlapping parts coincide.
- Handle multiple images and ensure the resulting panorama is correctly aligned without any regions being cut off.

Additionally, this project aims to visualize the keypoint matches used for image alignment to better understand how feature matching works in the panorama creation process.

└── output/            # Folder to store output images (optional)
```

#### **3. Core Techniques**

The project is built on several key computer vision techniques:

- **Keypoint Detection**: Identifying distinct points (keypoints) in an image that can be used to match overlapping regions between two images. We use the **SIFT** (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform) algorithm for this.
  
- **Feature Description**: Extracting feature descriptors that describe the region around each keypoint. These descriptors allow us to compare keypoints between different images.

- **Feature Matching**: Matching keypoints between images by comparing the feature descriptors. We use the **Brute Force Matcher** and **k-NN (k-nearest neighbors)** algorithm to find matches.

- **Homography Estimation**: Once keypoints are matched, we use **RANSAC** (Random Sample Consensus) to compute a homography matrix, which describes the transformation needed to align one image to another.

- **Perspective Warping**: Using the homography matrix, we warp one image so that it aligns with the next image in the sequence. This warping enables the creation of a panorama.

### **4. Detailed Explanation of the Code**

#### **4.1 `stitch_multi_auto.py`** – Main Driver Script

This script automates the process of loading, stitching, and visualizing keypoint matches for a series of images named in the format `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, and so on, from the `images/` folder.

1. **Image Loading (`load_images_from_folder`)**:
   - The function `load_images_from_folder` automatically scans the `images/` folder and loads images with filenames following the pattern `image{i}.jpg`. It stops when no more images are found.
   - The images are resized to a standard width of 400 pixels for faster processing, while maintaining the aspect ratio.

2. **Stitching Process**:
   - We initialize a `Stitcher` class object that handles stitching two images at a time.
   - Starting with the first image, the script stitches each subsequent image to the result of the previous stitch, creating a growing panorama.
   - The `stitch` function in the `Stitcher` class returns two outputs: 
     - The stitched panorama so far.
     - A visualization of the keypoint matches between the two images.

3. **Keypoint Matches Visualization**:
   - After each stitching step, the script displays the keypoint matches used to align the two images. This helps visualize how the algorithm finds corresponding points between the images and aligns them.
   - The program pauses after showing the matches, allowing the user to press a key before proceeding to the next image.

4. **Final Panorama**:
   - After all images are stitched together, the final panorama is displayed.

#### **4.2 `panorama.py`** – Stitcher Class

The `Stitcher` class encapsulates the logic for detecting keypoints, matching features, estimating homographies, and performing perspective warping. Here's how each method works:

1. **`detectAndDescribe(self, image)`**:
   - Converts the image to grayscale and detects keypoints using the **SIFT** algorithm.
   - Extracts feature descriptors from these keypoints, which are used for matching between images.

2. **`matchKeypoints(self, kpsA, kpsB, featuresA, featuresB, ratio, reprojThresh)`**:
   - Matches the feature descriptors between two images using a **BruteForce matcher** and applies **Lowe’s ratio test** to filter out poor matches.
   - Computes a **homography matrix** (a 3x3 transformation matrix) that aligns one image to another using **RANSAC**, ensuring robust matching even with noise or outliers.

3. **`stitch(self, images, ratio=0.75, reprojThresh=4.0, showMatches=False)`**:
   - The core method responsible for stitching two images together. It takes the matched keypoints and applies a **perspective warp** using the homography matrix to align the second image with the first.
   - The result is placed on a large canvas to prevent any part of the stitched image from being cut off.
   - If `showMatches=True`, it also returns a visualization of the keypoint matches.

4. **`drawMatches(self, imageA, imageB, kpsA, kpsB, matches, status)`**:
   - Draws lines between the matched keypoints in two images, providing a visual representation of the feature matching process.

### **5. Output Example**

After running the project with a set of images (e.g., `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, `image3.jpg`), the following happens:
1. **Keypoint Matches Visualization**: After each stitching step, keypoint matches between the current pair of images are displayed. This shows how features in the overlapping regions are used to align the images.
2. **Final Panorama**: Once all images are stitched together, the final panorama is displayed.

### **6. Running the Project**

To run the project:
1. **Place Images**: Place the images to be stitched in the `images/` folder and name them in the format `image1.jpg`, `image2.jpg`, etc.
2. **Run the Script**: Use the following command to run the project:
   ```bash
   python stitch.py
   ```
3. **Keypoint Matches**: As the images are stitched together, you'll see a visualization of the keypoint matches. Press any key to move on to the next image.
4. **Final Panorama**: After stitching all the images, the final panorama will be displayed.

### **7. Improvements and Future Work**

- **Blending**: Future improvements can involve blending techniques (like feathering) to smooth transitions between stitched images, making the panorama look seamless.
- **Dynamic Image Size**: The current implementation resizes all images to a fixed width of 400 pixels. For more robustness, you can dynamically adjust this based on the original image size.
  
### **Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how to use computer vision techniques for panorama stitching with OpenCV. It not only creates a stitched panorama from multiple images but also provides a clear visualization of how keypoint detection and feature matching work in practice.
